### About Me


I'm an aspiring programmer with a strong foundation in C and C++, on a journey to master the intricate arts of coding.
My coding adventures have led me to study at [Hive Helsinki]([https://www.hiveschool.io/](https://www.hive.fi/en/)), where I've honed my teamwork and peer-to-peer learning skills, becoming an agile and adaptable coder.

Beyond the realm of programming, I hold a Bachelor's degree in Educational Research and have an impressive 4 years of teaching experience, which has granted me the patience and adaptability needed for the ever-evolving programming cosmos.
I'm a curiosity-driven coder with the enthusiasm of a highly caffinated squirrel, always on the hunt for new projects and technology to explore in the vast world of programming.

### My coolest projects (at the time of writing)
[MiniRT](https://github.com/ShereeMorphett/MiniRT) : MiniRT is a raytracing program written in C that generates computer-generated images representing scenes with simple geometric objects and their own lighting systems. 
[MiniShell](https://github.com/jboucher154/Eggshell) : The Minishell project is a part of the 42-cursus group project, where we successfully built a simple shell program in C. 
[CPP modules](https://github.com/ShereeMorphett/libft_CPP) : The C++ modules were designed to give Hive students a basic understanding of C++ features, I also used this oppertunity to learn how build systems(meson) and testing frameworks(catch2) work.
