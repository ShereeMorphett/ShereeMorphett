# About Me 🌞


I'm an aspiring programmer with a strong foundation in C and C++.
My coding adventures have led me to study at [Hive Helsinki]([https://www.hiveschool.io/](https://www.hive.fi/en/)), where I've honed my teamwork and peer-to-peer learning skills, becoming an agile and adaptable coder.

I'm a curiosity-driven coder with the enthusiasm of a highly caffeinated squirrel, always on the hunt for new projects and technology to explore in the vast world of programming.

### My coolest projects (at the time of writing)

🌟 [MiniRT](https://github.com/ShereeMorphett/MiniRT): MiniRT is a raytracing program written in C that generates computer-generated images representing scenes with simple geometric objects and their own lighting systems. <br>
🐚 [MiniShell](https://github.com/jboucher154/Eggshell): The Minishell project is a part of the 42-cursus group project, where we successfully built a simple shell program in C. <br>
🚀 [CPP modules](https://github.com/ShereeMorphett/libft_CPP): The C++ modules were designed to give Hive students a basic understanding of C++ features, and I also used this opportunity to learn how build systems (meson) and testing frameworks (catch2) work.
🚀 [WebServer](https://github.com/ShereeMorphett/WebServer): Building a C++ Webserver from scratch (This project is still in progress).
