# About Me 🌞


I'm an aspiring programmer with a strong foundation in C, C++ and Python.
My coding adventures have led me to study at [Hive Helsinki]([https://www.hiveschool.io/](https://www.hive.fi/en/)), where I've honed my teamwork and peer-to-peer learning skills, becoming an agile and adaptable coder.

I'm a curiosity-driven coder with the enthusiasm of a highly caffeinated squirrel, always on the hunt for new projects and technology to explore in the vast world of programming.

### My coolest projects (at the time of writing)

🌟 [RT](https://github.com/marzer/rt): Regularly contributing to a C++ Raytracer that has multiple libraries, testing frameworks and using meson build system. Contributing to this project has given me the chance to work with experienced programmers and learn about best practices in modern C++ as well as having regular code reviews <br>
🌟 [MiniRT](https://github.com/ShereeMorphett/MiniRT): MiniRT is a raytracing program written in C that generates computer-generated images representing scenes with simple geometric objects and their own lighting systems. <br>
🐚 [MiniShell](https://github.com/jboucher154/Eggshell): The Minishell project is a part of the 42-cursus group project, where we successfully built a simple shell program in C. <br>
🚀 [CPP modules](https://github.com/ShereeMorphett/libft_CPP): The C++ modules were designed to give Hive students a basic understanding of C++ features, and I also used this opportunity to learn how build systems (meson) and testing frameworks (catch2) work.<br>
🚀 [WebServer](https://github.com/ShereeMorphett/WebServer): Building a C++ Webserver from scratch (This project is still in progress).
